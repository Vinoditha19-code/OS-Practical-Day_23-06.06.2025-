Practical_01 
Pipe:
The program demonstrates basic inter-process communication using a pipe within a single process. It writes three fixed-size messages into the pipe and reads them back sequentially, showcasing how data can be transferred through a unidirectional pipe using write() and read() system calls.

Question_01:
This program demonstrates the use of process creation using fork() in C. The parent process collects user input (name, registration number, and age), and the child process prints this information. The parent waits for the child to complete using wait(), illustrating basic parent-child process coordination and data sharing via inherited memory after a fork.
